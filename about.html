            <p class="image-description">The founders of Pre-Owned Lightly Used Luxury Cars were (and are!) normal human beings.</p>
            <p>Founded in 1984 under circumstances best left unspoken, Luxury Cars quickly grew from a humble small business to a mainstay of wealthy clients around the world. Our success can be attributed to our unique acquisition methods and special connections. Every car has its story, and somtimes those stories involve bad things. Yours won't though!</p>
